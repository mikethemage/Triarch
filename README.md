# Triarch - an unofficial editor for Tri-Stat RPGs

**Triarch** is a character creator for roleplaying games (RPGs) using Tri-Stat based systems.  Currently it only supports the 3rd edition of the Big Eyes, Small Mouth (BESM) RPG. 

It is currently a 64-bit Windows application using .Net 8.0.  Supported operating systems are Windows 10 x64 and higher.

Files can be saved in _.json_ format which can be reloaded later, or exported to _.txt_ for easier reading/manual formatting/printing etc.

The full list of 3rd Edition BESM character options are all enabled and supported and will calculate the relevant point costs accordingly.

This project is currently in development and therefore further features are planned but not yet available including:
* Printing/formatted text output
* Cross-platform support
* Alternate editions of BESM (e.g. 4th edition) or alternate Tri-Stat RPG systems

Inspired by, but **not** based on or in anyway affiliated with _[BESMCG](https://web.archive.org/web/20220422154557/http://www.technofetish.net/index.html)_, a character editor for BESM 2nd Edition.
